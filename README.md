## Conclusions <img src="figs/171205-224634-AIC.png" width="438" height="328" align="right">
- Model 3 performed slightly better when comparing relative goodness-of-fit due to low number of covariates
- However, all three models are very similar
- Positional covariates had the most explanatory power
- All the neurons showed some history dependence between 5-20 ms in the past as well as around 90-140 ms
