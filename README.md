* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### Rough classifications of cells ###
These are based on spike positions. One thing to consider is how often the rat was in the position bc that would affect spike count.

* Cell 1: Grid cell (5 fields)
* Cell 2: Grid cell (3 fields)
* Cell 3: MM (multimodal place cells)
* Cell 4: Grid and MM
* Cell 5: MM
* Cell 6: MM 
* Cell 7: MM
* Cell 8: Place cell (with field in middle)
* Cell 9: Place cell
* Cell 10: MM

### THE PLAN ###

* classify cells
* mess around w/different covariates to learn how they work
* match up the covariate sets to the cell groups & refine
* also Simon do you understand how glmfit actually works bc that would be helpful. Jing and I are confused.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin
* Other community or team contact
