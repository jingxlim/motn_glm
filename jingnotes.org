#+STARTUP: entitiespretty

* Initial plan

The TMNT are back for Project 2! Unless we get a new name idk.

** What is this repository for?
- Saucy remarks about highly gifted people
- Baltimore food recommendations
** Rough classifications of cells
These are based on spike positions. One thing to consider is how often the rat was in the position bc that would affect spike count.
- Cell 1: Grid cell (5 fields)
- Cell 2: Grid cell (3 fields)
- Cell 3: MM (multimodal place cells)
- Cell 4: Grid and MM
- Cell 5: MM
- Cell 6: Place + border conjuctive cell
- Cell 7: Place + border conjunctive cell
- Cell 8: Place cell (with field in middle)
- Cell 9: Place cell
- Cell 10: MM
** The plan
- classify cells
- mess around w/different covariates to learn how they work
- match up the covariate sets to the cell groups & refine
- also Simon do you understand how glmfit actually works bc that would be helpful. Jing and I are confused.

** Things to add [1/6]
- [X] calculate movement speed
- [ ] check formula for phi, movement direction
- [ ] plot the GLM fits of x velocity, y velocity, movement speed and heading direction along with the occupancy normalised histograms
- [ ] Construct confidence intervals about your model conditional intensity
- [ ] Characterize the relative goodness-of-fit among competing models i.e. deviance against the number of parameters (AIC)
- [ ] Characterize the goodness-of-fit between data and model (KS statistic and KS plot)
* 17NOV29
** History dependence
- to be safe, history dependence of 3 and above
