** Things to add [1/6]
- [X] calculate movement speed
- [ ] check formula for phi, movement direction
- [ ] plot the GLM fits of x velocity, y velocity, movement speed and heading direction along with the occupancy normalised histograms
- [ ] Construct confidence intervals about your model conditional intensity
- [ ] Characterize the relative goodness-of-fit among competing models i.e. deviance against the number of parameters (AIC)
- [ ] Characterize the goodness-of-fit between data and model (KS statistic and KS plot)
